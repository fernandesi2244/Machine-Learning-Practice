# Machine-Learning-Practice
A repository where I explore various machine learning techniques

## Scripts

### IrisFlowersClassification.py
In this script, I start off by analyzing a dataset to explore potential patterns in the data.
Then, I construct training and validation datasets to conduct testing.
Next, I construct several different models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), and a Suppport Vector Machine (SVM).
I then evaluate the efficacy of these various models on the particular dataset that I used in order to determine the final model to use.
Finally, I use the best model to predict results from the x_validation dataset so that the results can be compared to the y_validation dataset.
